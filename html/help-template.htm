<h3>1. Certificate Request Generation using WebCert</h3>
<hr />
<p>
If you already have a certificate request file (often
identified with a .csr extension), you can skip to 2.
</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="../images/new-certificate-data-entry-icon.png" alt="new certificate data entry" /></div>
<p>
In order to generate a new certificate, we need to create
a certificate signing request (CSR). The request will carry 
the name and possibly other details of its future owner.
Using <b>Create CSR</b> from the top menu bar will call
 buildrequest.cgi, and the necessary form will be displayed.
At a minimum, the Common Name (CN) of the future certificate
must be provided there. You can also select the key type
and size, or accept the displayed values as a standard.
</p>
<h3>2. External Certificate Generation</h3>
<hr />
<div class="pic"><img src="../images/webcert-request-paste-icon.png" alt="webcert request paste" /></div>
<p>
If you already have a certificate request, say its already
generated for you by a smart network or firewall device
(i.e. Cisco, Netscreen), you already got a key pair
that stays in the system. Here you simply cut and paste
the certificate request into the certrequest.cgi form
using the <b>Verify CSR</b> menu item, and generate the certificate.
Once done, simply import the certificate into your device.
</p>
<p>
A valid certificate request looks like this (example):
</p>
<pre>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
MIICGjCCAYMCAQAwgbQxCzAJBgNVBAgTAkNBMRMwEQYDVQQHEwpXaGVyZS1ldmVy

-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----</pre>
<p>
You need to paste such a request, including the "Begin" and
"End" lines, into the certrequest.cgi form and press [verify].
</p>
<h3>3. Certificate Request Verification</h3>
<hr />
<div class="pic"><img src="../images/new-certificate-key-and_extensions-icon.png" alt="new certificate key and extensions" /></div>
<p>
After a external certificate request has been pasted into WebCert,
or WebCerts certificate building form has been used, a verification
will show you the certificate information that will be signed.
</p>
<p>
Here, several additional certificate extensions can be set such as
the <b>key usage</b>, defining the type of the certificate.
The extended key usage option can be be added to certificates who *really*
need it. Please enable this option only if you are sure this is
needed. For example, server certificates used with Microsoft Windows
to enable the Active Directory ldaps:// function need the addition of
the "SSL/TLS Web Server Authentication" extended key usage setting.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> An externally generated certificate request, that is pasted
into Webcert could already carry certificate extensions.
In that case, WebCert uses their requested values and does not
provide the option to override that data.
</p>
<p>
Next, we need to define the start and end date the certificate
should become valid for. The default selection will set it to
become valid immediately, with a expiration date of 3 years. The
expiration date can be changed, or specific time frames can be
set to precisely define the time period.
</p>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> If Webcert was used to create the certificate
request together with the key, we need to save the private key
which is displayed only here. For security reasons, no other
copy is kept on the server. Simply copy&amp;paste the displayed PEM
key data into a local text file.
</p>

<h3>4. Certificate Signing</h3>
<hr />
<p>
Finally, we use <b>Sign Request</b> to generate the certificate,
singing it with WebCerts root CA certificate. If the process is
successful, you'll get a certificate displayed that looks like
this:
</p>
<p>
<pre>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

-----END CERTIFICATE-----</pre>
</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="../images/new-certificate-generated-icon.png" alt="new certificate generated" /></div>
<p>
Now you can cut and paste it via an editor such as Windows Notepad
into a text file and save it locally. Alternatively, you can use
the <b>Export</b> functions to download the certificate as a file.
<br />
A detailed description for generating a S/Mime certificate to
enable e-mail encryption is here:
<a href="http://fm4dd.com/howto/openssl/webcert-smime-howto.htm">
http://fm4dd.com/howto/openssl/webcert-smime-howto.htm</a>
</p>
<h3>5. Certificate Export</h3>
<hr />
<p>
Certificates can be exported for easy download in either DER, PEM
or PKCS12 format. When requested for the first time, the selected
format is written to the /export directory on the WebCert server,
and a download link is provided to save the file locally.
</p>
<p>
To create a PKCS12 container for easy use with Windows S/MIME you
will need the previously generated private key in PEM format for
pasting it into the export form. The PKCS12 container will be
secured with the supplied passphrase in the export form. This
passphrase is needed when the .p12 file is imported by Windows.
</p>
<h3>6. Certificate Installation</h3>
<hr />
<p>
Certificates can be installed/loaded from the cut&amp;paste text files
or from the downloaded certificate files which were exported.
For some applications, the filename must have a certain extension
such as [certfile].pem for PEM files - try to rename it if that is
the case. Sometimes it is also necessary to co-install the CA Root
certificate to enable the verification of the generated certificate.
WebCerts singing Root CA certificate is available for download
through the <b>Root CA Cert</b> menu item.
</p>
<h3>7. Certificate Management</h3>
<hr />
<div class="pic"><img src="../images/webcert-certificate-store-icon.png" alt="webcert certificate store" /></div>
<p>
All certificates are stored in the /cert directory on the WebCert
server. They can be viewed with the <b>List Certs</b> menu option.
WebCert conveniently displays the certificate subject, along with
 the remaining time each certificate is valid.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Detail</b> button displays the certificate data including its PEM
 format, convenient for importing it into various certificate stores.
The <b>Renew</b> button creates a new CSR from the existing certificate 
data for simple renewal.
</p>
<h3>8. Certificate Search</h3>
<hr />
<div class="pic"><img src="../images/webcert-certificate-search-icon.png" alt="webcert certificate search" /></div>
<p>
To find a particular certificate, the <b>Search Cert</b> menu option
brings up a selection of filters that will extract the applicable certs
from the cert store per subject field, serial number, validation or
expiration date. For example, this helps to identify certificates that
are about to expire, and let us renew them before they become invalid.
</p>

<h3>9. Certificate Validation</h3>
<hr />
<div class="pic"><img src="../images/webcert-certificate-validation-icon.png" alt="webcert certificate validation" /></div>
<p>
The <b>Verify Certs</b> menu option is a powerful way to identify
issues around certificates. A crucial part of using certificates
lies in the validation through a chain of "signing" certificates.
With this function, the chain can be constructed and verified,
similar to the way applications, such as a web browser would do.
This works with all certificates, not just the ones created with
WebCert.
</p>
<p>This function can upload local certificate files, or it can connect
directly to a remote SSL server and extract the certificate data
from there. It is very convenient to verify if a servers SSL setup
is correct.
</p>

<h3>10. Common Errors</h3>
<hr />
<p>
Not including the "Begin" or "End" lines, or having an additional
empty line before or after the "Begin" or "End" lines when 
pasting the request into the form will result in a "Error invalid
request format, no BEGIN/END lines". 
</p>
<p>
Accidentially hitting [return] somewhere in the paste window,
generating a newline in the request data, will result in a
"Error cant read request content with PEM function".
</p>
<p>
In short, CAREFULLY pasting the request resolves most errors.
</p>
<p>
Trying to generate a certificate from a request that has been
already processed works just fine.
</p>
<h3>11. Browser Complaints</h3>
<hr />
<p>
Browser constantly asks if this certificate can be trusted and
complains about various things:
</p>
<p>
Importing the Root CA "parent" certificate can help resolve
this issue. Thats what the "Get Root CA cert" is for. Loading
the Root CA into your browser enables the automatic
verification of the certificate every time you connect. No
questions asked.
</p>
<p>
If there is still the window popping up asking if you want
to accept this certificate, then its mostly a missmatch between
the certificate common name (CN) and the device name/server
name/device IP/server IP.  Either the certificate was requested
wrongly, or the device changed its name/IP recently. Ask the
device owner to generate a new certificate (request) with the
valid device name/IP entry.
</p>
<p>
Certificates are signed to be valid for a time range and
"expire". The expiration defaults to 3 years. This should
give plenty of time to regenerate a new certificate when
the time comes. Certificates still can work when when expired,
but the browser comes up with and error message. Re-
certification of devices is a good way to enforce inventory
updates.
</p>
<p>
OpenSSL on 32-bit systems may encounter the year-2038 bug.
WebCert can restrict the certificate generation prior to
the critical date.

<h3>CA Policy</h3>
<hr />
<h4>Certification Practise Statement (CPS)</h4>
<p>
This is a experimental CA for demonstration and educational
purposes only. There is no warranty that this software and
generated certificates work. Generated certificates do not
imply any ownership verifications and have no other link
to the author except through the public access to the auto-
generation with this software. Requests are signed in an
automated fashion.  Future certificate retrieval  or site
availability is uncertain.
</p>
<p>
I'm not responsible for misuse or missrepresentation.
This is NOT a classified CA.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the software does not manage a signed certificate
database. A CRL is generated, but may run out-of-date. A copy of the
certificate is saved on this server.

<h3>About WebCert</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
Digital Certificates are needed everywhere in today's world. They are used to enable SSL-protected web traffic, e-mail encryption and other technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
To get a digital certificate, you'll either have to order one from a commercial provider such as Verisign who usually charges $$$, or you have to install, configure and run your own certificate authority. This costs also $$ and, at the very least is something more you need to learn and manage, which is time and resource consuming. Often we don't need the extensive functionality and complexity of a full CA management system with its distributed structure, separation of requestor and signer and the database structures to manage it all.
    </p>
    <p>
For these reasons I wrote WebCert as a lightweight self-service application. It allows me to quickly generate certificates on my own, and to enable my colleagues without knowledge of the details to do so as well. The first version became an instant hit with over 300 certificate generations per year. It encouraged me to improve it to the version you see here.
    </p>
    <p>
WebCert is using the OpenSSL libraries for certificate operations. It is not just a frontend to the OpenSSL program, but independently written. It only requires standard C libraries,  the OpenSSL libraries and the CGIC library from Thomas Boutell. No, you don't need to maintain any of the web-application enabling technologies like JSP, PHP, Phyton... and no database is required, either.  WebCert is using simple CGI technology for easiest installation and maintenance.

External Dependencies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Thomas Boutell's CGIC library, see http://www.boutell.com/cgic/</li>
      <li> OpenSSL libary and headers, see http://www.openssl.org/</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
It is highly adviseable to provide access control and SSL encryption to the WebCert interface for any use other then experimental. The webserver writeable certificate and export directory should be secured (i.e. by a Apache &lt;Directory&gt; directive).

If you want to do something really nice and encouraging besides just saying "Thanks", send me a photo or picture of the area you are living in: either your town, your work, local sights or of your neighborhood.  I would enjoy it very much. Cheers.
